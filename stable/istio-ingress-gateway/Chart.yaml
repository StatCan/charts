description: |
  This chart deploys an opinionated Istio ngress-gateway. It uses the Istio Operator to deploy the Istio components and cert-manager to handle certificate generation.

  Currently, only HTTPS configurations are available (with automatic HTTPS redirect from HTTP if configured), however, more Gateways and capbabilities may be added when the need arises.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 2.1.0
